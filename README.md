# germanRadarAnalysis_runCelltrack

This repository is part of the germanRADARanalysis project. More details about the project can be found on [my personal website](https://lochbihler.nl/?page_id=302).

## Usage

There is only one script in this repository: run_celltrack_parallel.sh

It will run [the rain cell tracking software celltrack](https://github.com/lochbika/celltrack) on a number of files in parallel, as defined in the script. Please, refer to [this blogpost](https://lochbihler.nl/apply-rain-cell-tracking-to-20-years-of-rain-radar-data-over-germany/) for more information.
